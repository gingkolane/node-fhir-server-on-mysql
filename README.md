# node-fhir-server-on-mysql

-- Project Under Development --

This is a FHIR server built on Asymmetrik node-fhir-server-core framework (https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core), using mysql8 database as data store.

Following a pilot project node-fhir-server-on-sqlite (https://github.com/gingkolane/node-fhir-server-on-sqlite), I used the more powerful mysql8 for data store for this server. To take advantage of mysql8's X DevAPI (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/) to further streamline the mapping and data storing from fhir resource to a relational database.
